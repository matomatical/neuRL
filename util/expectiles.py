            all of the expectiles are just equal to the points.
        tau (float or array-like of floats): asymmetric ratio (or ratios)
            of expectiles to compute, each between 0 and 1 inclusive.
        sorted_sample (bool): Mark sample as already sorted. Default: False,
            assumes sample is not sorted, sorts sample into a new array.

        expectiles (float or np.ndarray of floats): vector of computed
